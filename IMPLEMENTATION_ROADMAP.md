# Implementation Roadmap

> **Ready for Production Implementation**
>
> This roadmap guides the 8-week development timeline for the European Night Train Advocacy Platform, targeting the September 26, 2025 Pajama Party event.

> Update (2025‚Äë08‚Äë27): TripHop integration and `/api/places` were removed. Steps referring to TripHop and places APIs are legacy. Current roadmap uses user‚Äësubmitted dreams and plans OpenRailwayMap stations via offline fetch + viewport API. See `docs/CLAUDE_CODEX_COLLABORATION.md`.

## üéØ **Implementation Guidelines for Claude Code**
