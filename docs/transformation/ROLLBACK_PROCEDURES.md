## 🔄 Git-Based Rollback Procedures

### Branch Strategy Rollback
Current branch structure:
```
main (production-ready)
├── feature/strategic-transformation-sept26
    ├── feature/analytics-privacy-foundation
    ├── feature/map-central-hub
    ├── feature/interview-mode
    ├── feature/accessibility-wcag
    └── feature/performance-optimization
```

#### Level 1: Feature Branch Rollback
**Scenario:** Single feature causing issues
```bash
# Rollback to previous feature state
git checkout feature/strategic-transformation-sept26
git revert <problematic-commit-hash>
git push origin feature/strategic-transformation-sept26

# Or reset to last known good state
git reset --hard <last-good-commit>
git push --force-with-lease origin feature/strategic-transformation-sept26
```

#### Level 2: Full Transformation Rollback
**Scenario:** Transformation branch has fundamental issues
```bash
# Switch back to main branch
git checkout main

# Remove transformation branch (if necessary)
git branch -D feature/strategic-transformation-sept26

# Restart from clean state if needed
git checkout -b feature/strategic-transformation-sept26-v2
```

#### Level 3: Production Rollback
**Scenario:** Issues discovered after merge to main
```bash
# Revert the merge commit
git checkout main
git revert -m 1 <merge-commit-hash>
git push origin main

# Or reset to pre-transformation state
git reset --hard <pre-transformation-commit>
git push --force origin main  # Only if no other changes
```

## 📦 Component-Level Rollback

### Analytics System Rollback
**Issue:** Analytics causing performance problems or privacy concerns

#### Quick Disable
```bash
# Remove analytics script from layout
# Comment out Plausible script in app/layout.tsx
# Disable event tracking temporarily
```

#### Files to Revert
- `app/layout.tsx` (analytics script)
- `src/components/analytics/` (entire directory)
- `app/impact/` (dashboard route)
- Environment variables (PLAUSIBLE_DOMAIN)

#### Verification Steps
- [ ] Analytics script removed from page source
- [ ] No analytics events firing
- [ ] Dashboard route returns 404
- [ ] Cookie consent banner hidden

### Map System Rollback
**Issue:** Map performance degradation or functionality loss

#### Preserve Data, Rollback UI
```bash
# Keep API and data intact
# Revert only frontend map components
git checkout main -- src/components/map/
git checkout main -- app/page.tsx
```

#### Files to Revert
- `app/page.tsx` (homepage layout)
- `src/components/map/DreamMap.tsx`
- `src/components/map/MapLayerManager.tsx`
- `src/components/map/MapPerformanceOptimizer.tsx`

#### Verification Steps
- [ ] Homepage loads with original layout
- [ ] Map functionality restored
- [ ] Dream data still accessible
- [ ] Mobile performance acceptable

### Interview Mode Rollback
**Issue:** QR system or offline functionality problems

#### Clean Removal
```bash
# Remove interview route entirely
rm -rf app/interview/
# Remove QR generation API
rm -rf app/api/qr/
# Remove offline service worker
rm -f public/sw.js
```

#### Files to Revert
- `app/interview/` (entire route)
- `app/api/qr/` (QR generation)
- `src/components/interview/` (components)
- Service worker files

#### Verification Steps
- [ ] /interview route returns 404
- [ ] QR generation API disabled
- [ ] No offline capabilities
- [ ] Main platform unaffected

## 💾 Database Rollback Procedures

### Backup Strategy
**Before Each Major Change:**
```bash
# Create backup before major changes
pg_dump $DATABASE_URL > backup_pre_transformation_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).sql

# Or using Supabase CLI
supabase db dump --file backup_pre_transformation.sql
```

### Schema Rollback
**Migration Rollback:**
```bash
# Rollback latest migration
npm run migrate:rollback

# Rollback to specific migration
npm run migrate:rollback --to=migration_name

# Reset to previous schema backup
psql $DATABASE_URL < backup_pre_transformation.sql
```

### Data Integrity Checks
**Post-Rollback Verification:**
```sql
-- Verify dream data integrity
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM dreams WHERE created_at > '2025-08-20';

-- Check participant data
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM participants WHERE created_at > '2025-08-20';

-- Validate data consistency
SELECT * FROM dreams WHERE from_station IS NULL OR to_station IS NULL;
```

## 🌐 Deployment Rollback

### Vercel Deployment Rollback
**Production Environment:**
```bash
# List recent deployments
vercel list

# Rollback to previous deployment
vercel rollback <deployment-url>

# Or promote specific deployment
vercel promote <deployment-url> --scope=<team>
```

### Environment Variables Rollback
**Restore Previous Configuration:**
```bash
# Backup current variables
vercel env ls > env_backup_$(date +%Y%m%d).txt

# Remove new variables
vercel env rm PLAUSIBLE_DOMAIN
vercel env rm ANALYTICS_API_KEY

# Restore from backup if needed
```

### CDN Cache Invalidation
**Clear Cached Content:**
```bash
# Force fresh deployment
vercel deploy --prod --force

# Clear CDN cache (if using external CDN)
# Provider-specific commands here
```

## 🧪 Testing Rollback Procedures

### Rollback Testing Strategy
**Test all rollback procedures in staging environment first**

#### Pre-Rollback Checklist
- [ ] Identify specific issue requiring rollback
- [ ] Document current state for future reference
- [ ] Notify stakeholders of impending rollback
- [ ] Prepare communication about temporary reversion

#### Post-Rollback Validation
- [ ] All critical functionality restored
- [ ] Performance metrics back to baseline
- [ ] No data loss occurred
- [ ] User experience acceptable
- [ ] Monitoring shows stable metrics

### Automated Rollback Testing
```bash
# Test suite for rollback scenarios
npm run test:rollback

# Verify baseline functionality
npm run test:smoke

# Check data integrity
npm run test:data-integrity
```

## 🔧 Recovery Procedures

### Post-Rollback Analysis
**Required Before Re-Attempting:**
1. **Root Cause Analysis**
   - Identify exact cause of failure
   - Document why issue wasn't caught in testing
   - Update testing procedures to catch similar issues

2. **Testing Enhancement**
   - Add specific tests for the failure scenario
   - Enhance monitoring for early detection
   - Improve staging environment accuracy

3. **Implementation Improvement**
   - Fix underlying issue completely
   - Add safeguards to prevent recurrence
   - Consider gradual rollout strategy

### Re-Implementation Strategy
**After Successful Rollback:**
```
1. Fix issues in development environment
2. Enhanced testing in staging
3. Gradual re-deployment with monitoring
4. Canary release if possible
5. Full deployment only after validation
```
