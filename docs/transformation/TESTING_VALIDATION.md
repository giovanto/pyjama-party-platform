# Testing & Validation Procedures
## Strategic Platform Transformation

Comprehensive testing strategy to ensure platform reliability, accessibility, and performance for the September 26th event.

---

## 🎯 Testing Strategy Overview

### Testing Pyramid
```
       🔺 E2E Tests (User Flows)
      🔺🔺 Integration Tests (API/Components)
    🔺🔺🔺 Unit Tests (Functions/Components)
```

### Quality Gates
Each phase must pass all tests before proceeding to the next phase.
