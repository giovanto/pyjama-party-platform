# Privacy Compliance Validation - Analytics Foundation

## Overview
This document validates the privacy-first analytics implementation for GDPR compliance and transparent advocacy data collection.

## GDPR Compliance Checklist

### âœ… Lawful Basis for Processing
- **Legitimate Interest**: Advocacy for night train infrastructure
- **Explicit Consent**: Required via cookie consent banner before any tracking
- **Transparent Purpose**: Clearly communicated that data supports advocacy efforts

### âœ… Data Minimization
- Only tracking essential metrics for advocacy:
  - Dream submission counts
  - Participation level preferences
  - Station selection patterns (aggregated)
  - Geographic interest (country-level only)
- No personal identifiers stored in analytics
- No tracking across external websites
- No behavioral profiling

### âœ… Consent Management
- **Explicit Consent**: Clear opt-in via cookie banner
- **Granular Control**: Users can accept or decline
- **Withdrawable**: Users can revoke consent at any time
- **Advocacy Messaging**: Explains how data supports night train lobbying

### âœ… Data Retention & Deletion
- **Automatic Expiry**: All analytics events expire after 30 days
- **Database Function**: `cleanup_expired_analytics_events()` removes old data
- **No Long-term Storage**: No permanent analytics database
- **Consent Storage**: Only consent choice stored locally (localStorage)

### âœ… Transparency & User Rights
- **Clear Messaging**: "We count dreams to lobby for night trains"
- **Purpose Explanation**: Data used for policymaker demonstrations
- **Public Dashboard**: Aggregated data shown transparently
- **No Hidden Tracking**: All tracking purposes disclosed

## Technical Implementation Validation

### Cookie Consent Banner
```typescript
// âœ… Compliant Implementation
- Shows clear advocacy message
- Requires explicit action (no pre-checked boxes)
- Allows easy decline
- Provides privacy settings control
- Stores consent choice locally only
```

### Analytics Data Collection
```typescript
// âœ… Privacy-First Design
- No cookies used by Plausible.io
- Event data automatically expires (30 days)
- No personal identifiers tracked
- Rate limiting prevents abuse
- Sanitized event properties only
```

### Data Processing
```sql
-- âœ… Database Level Privacy
- analytics_events table with expires_at column
- Automatic cleanup functions
- Row Level Security enabled
- No PII constraints enforced
- Public read only for non-expired data
```

## Advocacy Data Collection Strategy

### What We Track (with consent)
1. **Dream Submissions**
   - Total count for impact demonstration
   - Participation level selection
   - Country-level geographic distribution
   - Route popularity (aggregated)

2. **Engagement Metrics**
   - Form completion rates
   - Participation tier selection
   - Station search patterns
   - Event attendance signups

### What We DON'T Track
- Personal names or emails in analytics
- Individual user journeys
- Cross-site tracking
- Device fingerprinting
- Persistent user identification
- Behavioral profiling

## Public Dashboard Transparency

### Available Metrics (Public API)
- `/api/impact/dreams-count`: Total participation numbers
- `/api/impact/routes-popular`: Most requested routes
- `/api/impact/growth-chart`: Movement growth over time
- `/api/impact/stations-ready`: Critical mass by station

### Data Presentation
- Only aggregated data shown
- No individual user data exposed
- Geographic data at country/city level only
- Clear source attribution

## Privacy Rights Implementation

### Right to Access
- Users can view all public aggregated data
- No individual profiles to access

### Right to Rectification
- Not applicable (no personal data stored)

### Right to Erasure
- Automatic via 30-day expiry
- Consent withdrawal stops new collection

### Right to Data Portability
- Not applicable (no personal profiles)

### Right to Object
- Cookie consent banner allows objection
- Privacy settings allow withdrawal
