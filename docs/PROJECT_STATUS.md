# Project Status - Ready for Implementation

> Note (2025â€‘08â€‘27): TripHop integration and `/api/places` were removed. Items referencing TripHop imports and places APIs are legacy. Current approach: textâ€‘only station inputs; sanitized public views; OpenRailwayMap stations integration (offline fetch + viewport API) planned. See `docs/CLAUDE_CODEX_COLLABORATION.md`.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Current State**

The European Night Train Advocacy Platform has been completely architected and organized for production implementation. The codebase is clean, documented, and ready for development.

## âœ… **Completed Architecture**

### **System Design**
- [x] Complete system architecture in `docs/SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md`
- [x] Progressive disclosure user journey (6 phases)
- [x] Database schema with multilingual support (PostgreSQL + JSONB)
- [x] API design with validation and error handling
- [x] Testing strategy (unit, integration, E2E)
- [x] Production deployment plan for `pyjama-party.back-on-track.eu`

### **Data Integration**
- [x] Sanitized public views in Supabase (`public_dreams`, `public_pyjama_parties`)
- [x] Rate limiting and CORS allowlist configured
- [ ] OpenRailwayMap stations (offline fetch + viewport API)
- [x] Data fetching automation (`scripts/fetch-places.js`)

### **Documentation**
- [x] Comprehensive README with project overview
- [x] Development guide for local setup
- [x] Deployment guide for production
- [x] System architecture documentation
- [x] Legacy documentation archived

### **Project Organization**
- [x] Clean directory structure
- [x] Environment configuration templates
- [x] Archive old/unused documentation
- [x] Git history maintained and ready for commit
