**Enhancement Strategy:** Integrate specific climate deadlines and consequences

##### Enhanced Messages:

**Global Urgency (EU Green Deal Context):**
- **Primary:** "Europe has 6 years to cut transport emissions by 90%"
- **Supporting:** "The EU Green Deal demands carbon neutrality by 2050 - night trains are essential infrastructure for meeting this goal"
- **Action Connection:** "Every dream route you share strengthens the case for the rail investment Europe needs now"

**Personal Timeline Urgency:**
- **Primary:** "Climate change won't wait - but sustainable travel options are available today"
- **Supporting:** "While politicians debate, you can choose low-carbon travel that's comfortable, affordable, and available now"
- **Action Connection:** "Your participation in the pajama party demonstrates immediate demand for climate solutions"

**European Transport Crisis:**
- **Primary:** "Aviation accounts for 3.8% of EU emissions and growing rapidly"
- **Supporting:** "Pre-COVID flight growth was 5% annually - without alternatives like night trains, transport emissions will derail climate goals"
- **Action Connection:** "Show policymakers that Europeans want sustainable alternatives to flying"

### Data-Driven Impact Messaging

#### Enhanced Environmental Comparisons

**Current:** "90% lower emissions than flying"
**Enhanced Multi-Metric Comparison:**

| Route Example | Flight Emissions | Night Train Emissions | Carbon Saved | Equivalent Impact |
